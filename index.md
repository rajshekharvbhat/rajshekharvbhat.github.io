title: About Me
---

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://ee.iitdh.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Dharwad, India](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/). My research interests lie in the broad area of wireless communications and deep learning. I focus on developing energy-efficient, near-optimal algorithms for the timely delivery of fresh information in emerging wireless networks, while also optimizing energy harvesting and leveraging deep learning for low-latency communications. Additionally, my interests extend to semantic and beyond-Shannon communications for next-generation networks like 6G. I am also engaged in the practical applications of this research. Currently, I am involved in the hardware implementation of the DVB-S2X standard, which enhances satellite transmission efficiency, and the development of IoT boards for real-world applications in precision agriculture.
